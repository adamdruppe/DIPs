## Abstract

Currently, D functions default to being `@system`. This DIP proposes changing the default to `@safe`.

## Rationale

When D was first developed, there was little interest in the extra safety checks
introduced by `@safe`. But as the costs of unsafe code have become ever more apparent
and expensive, and `@safe` has grown more capable, the balance has shifted. Users expect
safety to be opt-out, not opt-in.


## Prior Work

* Other languages such as Rust and C# have safety as opt-out, rather than opt-in.
* A previous draft proposal: [@safe-by-default First Draft](https://github.com/dlang/DIPs/pull/153)

## Description

Functions such as template functions, nested functions, and lambdas that are not annotated
currently have their `@safe` / `@system` attribute inferred. This behavior will not change.
Any other unannotated function that will now be assumed to be `@safe` rather than `@system`.

Because this is expected to break a lot of existing code, it will be enabled with the
compiler switch:

```
-preview=safedefault
```

There are no grammar changes.

## Breaking Changes and Deprecations

This will likely break most code that has not already been annotated with `@safe`,
`@trusted`, or `@system`. Fortunately, the solution is easy, although tedious: annotate
functions that aren't safe with `@trusted` or `@system`.
