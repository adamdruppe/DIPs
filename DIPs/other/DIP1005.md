## Abstract

A Dependency-Carrying Declaration is a D declaration that does not require any
`import` declaration to be present outside of it. Such declarations encapsulate
their own dependencies, which makes dependency relationships more fine-grained
than traditional module- and package-level dependencies.

Currently D allows definitions to carry their own dependencies by means of the
recently-added scoped `import` declarations feature. However, this is not
possible with symbols that are present in the symbol declaration itself, for
example as function parameter types or template constraints. The limitation
reduces the applicability and power of scoped imports. This DIP proposes a
language addition called "inline import", which allows any function and
aggregate D declarations to be transformed into a Dependency-Carrying
Declaration.

## Rationale

Consider the following D code:

```d
import std.datetime;
import std.stdio;
void log(string message)
{
    writeln(Clock.currTime, ' ', message);
}
```

Traditionally (though not required by the language), `import`s are placed at
the top of the module and then implicitly used by the declarations in the
module. This has two consequences. First, the setup establishes a dependency of
the current module on two other modules or packages (and by transitivity, on
the transitive closure of the modules/packages those depend on). Second, it
defines a _relationship at distance_ between the `log` function and the
`import`s at the top. As a immediate practical consequence, `log` cannot be
moved across the codebase without ensuring the appropriate `import`
declarations are present in the target module.

Let us compare and contrast the setup above with the following:

```d
void log(string message)
{
    import std.datetime;
    import std.stdio;
    writeln(Clock.currTime, ' ', message);
}
```

This layout still preserves the dependency of the current module on the two
`std` entities because the compiler would need them in order to compile `log`.
However, the relationship at distance disappears---`log` encapsulates its
dependencies, which migrate together with it. We call such a declaration that
does not depend on `import`s outside of it, a _Dependency-Carrying
Declaration_.

Consider now the case when `log` is a generic function:

```d
void log(T)(T message)
{
    import std.datetime;
    import std.stdio;
    writeln(Clock.currTime, ' ', message);
}
```

In this case, the current module depends on `std.datetime` and `std.stdio` only
if it uses `log` directly from within a non-template function (including a
unittest). Otherwise, the `log` generic function is only parsed to an AST
(no symbol lookup) and not processed further. Should another module import
this module and use `log`, the dependency is realized because `log` needs
to be compiled. This makes the module that actually uses `log`---and only
it---dependent on `std.datetime` and `std.stdio`, in addition of course to
the module that defines `log`.

The same reasoning applies to template `struct`, `class`, or `interface` definitions:

```d
struct FileBuffer(Range)
{
    import std.stdio;
    private File output;
    ...
}
```

Such an entity only realizes the dependencies when actually instantiated,
therefore moving the carried dependencies to the point of instantiation.

The analysis above reveals that Dependency-Carrying Declarations have multiple
benefits:

* Specifies dependencies at declaration level, not at module level. This allows
  reasoning about the dependency cost of declarations in separation instead of
  aggregated at module level.
* If all declarations use Dependency-Carrying style and there is no top-level
  `import`, human reviewers and maintainers can immediately tell where each
  symbol in a given declaration comes from. This is a highly nontrivial
  exercise without specialized editor support in projects that pull several
  other modules and packages wholesale. Even a project newcomer could gather an
  understanding of a declaration without needing to absorb an arbitrary amount
  of implied context from the declaration at the top of the module.
* Dependency-Carrying Declarations are easier to move around, making for
  simpler and faster refactorings.
* Dependency-Carrying Declarations allow scalable template libraries. Large
  libraries (such as D's standard library itself) are customarily distributed
  in packages and modules grouped by functional areas, such that client code
  can use the library without needing to `import` many dozens of small modules,
  each for one specific declaration. Conversely, client code often `import`s a
  package or module to use just a small fraction of it. Distributing a template
  library in the form of Dependency-Carrying Declarations creates a scalable,
  pay-as-you-go setup: The upfront cost of `import`ing such a module is only
  that of parsing the module source, which can reasonably be considered
  negligible in the economy of any build. Then, dependencies are pulled on a
  need basis depending on the declarations used by client code.

Dependency-Carrying Declarations also have drawbacks:

* If most declarations in a module need the same `import`s, then factoring them
  outside the declarations at top level is simpler and better than repeating
  them.
* Related, renaming one module is likely to require more edits in a
  Dependency-Carrying Declarations setup.
* Traditional dependency-tracking tools such as `make` and other build systems
  assume file-level dependencies and need special tooling (such as `rdmd`) in
  order to work efficiently.
* Dependencies at the top of a module are easier to inspect quickly than
  dependencies spread through the module.

On the whole, experience with using Dependency-Carrying Declarations in the D
standard library suggests that the advantages outweigh disadvantages
considerably. Of all `import` declarations in the D standard library, only
about 10% are top-level---all others are local. Using local `import`s is
considered good style in D code.

There are, however, declarations that cannot be reformulated in
Dependency-Carrying Declaration form. Consider a simple example of a
non-template function declaration:

```d
import std.stdio;
void process(File input);
```

It is not possible to declare `process` without importing `std.stdio` outside
of it. Another situation is that of template constraints:

```d
import std.range;
struct Buffered(Range) if (isInputRange!Range) { ... }
```

There are combinations as well:

```d
import std.range, std.stdio;
void fun(Range)(Range r, File f) if (isInputRange!Range) { ... }
```

In all of these cases the only way to state the declarations is to make the
symbols they use visible in the scope outside it, which in turn requires the
use of `import` statements separately from the declarations that use them.

This, combined with the ubiquitous use of static introspection and constrained
templates, has led to an unpleasant situation in the D standard library whereby
it is practically impossible to eliminate `import`s at the top level. To date,
in spite of a [large effort](https://issues.dlang.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13253) to
place `import`s locally, the dependency structure of the D standard library has
not clarified visibly because of this limitation.

## Workaround: Increasing Granularity of Modules

The obvious workaround to the problem that dependencies must be module-level is
to simply define many small modules---in the extreme, one per declaration. Each
such small module would import the modules on which that declaration depends.
For convenience, `package.d` modules may be provided to aggregate several
modules.

This approach has the following tradeoffs:

* Reduces unnecessary parsing: if used appropriately, only code that is used
  actually gets parsed.
* Increases I/O: more small files cause more I/O activity. This may cause
  problems with large projects on shared network drives.
* Library authors face a tension between organizing code in logical units
  pertaining to the problem domain, and organizing code according to low-level
  dependency details. They will also be forced to routinely navigate large file
  hierarchies with many files, which may not be the preferred project
  organization.
* Client code must choose between using detailed import lists or convenient
  `package.d` imports.
    * If convenient grouped imports are used, the advantage of fine-grained
      dependency control is lost.
    * If detailed import lists are used, they are verbose and must be updated
      often. Because it is not an error to not use an imported symbol, over
      time the import lists will become a large set including the actually
      needed set, thus eroding the advantage of the approach in the first
      place. Special tooling and maintenance tasks would be needed to remove
      unneeded imports once in a while.

Such a project organization may be affordable for small and medium-sized
projects and is not precluded by this proposal. An example of such an approach
can be found in the [`mach.d`](https://github.com/pineapplemachine/mach.d)
library. It is organized as a small number of related declarations (such as
`canAdjoin`, `Adjoin`, and `AdjoinFlat`) per module, along with documentation
and unit tests. Currently `mach.d` has about 49 KLoC (as `wc` counts)
distributed across 348 files. The average file length is 141 LoC and the median
is 94 LoC. Each package offers collected `package.d` modules for convenience
that import all small modules in the current package. Client code has the
option of using more verbose single imports for precise dependencies, or these
terse coarse-granular imports at the cost of less precision in dependency
management.

Assuming module size is a project invariant, the number of files scales roughly
with project size. This means `mach.d` would need 2000 files to scale up to the
same size as the D standard library (about 6x larger) or about 7000 files to
scale up to 1 MLoC. For comparison, Facebook's
[hhvm](https://github.com/facebook/hhvm) project includes about 1 MLoC of C++
code, distributed across 1235 headers and 1187 implementation files (median
across all is 141 LoC/file, average 379 LoC/file without counting documentation
or unittests). The prospect of tripling the number of files in the project
would be tenuous, even if the payoff would be superior dependency management.
(For another comparison point, the D Standard Library itself has about 282 KLoC
distributed across 137 modules with median length 903 LoC and average length
2055 LoC; these include full documentation and unittests.)

We consider such a workaround nonscalable and undesirable for large-scale
projects. It puts in tension the convenience of coarse-granular organization
and the organizational advantage of of fine-grained dependencies. The
workaround also adds additional project management chores (refreshing the lists
of imports, enforcing disciplined use). This proposal eliminates the tension
between the two, making them affordable simultaneously.

## Workaround: Are Local Imports Good Enough?

A legitimate question to ask is whether consistent use of local imports
wherever possible would be an appropriate approximation of the
Dependency-Carrying Declarations goal with no change in the language at all.
The reasoning is that most dependencies are actually needed by implementations,
not declarations; once all local imports are moved where needed by the
implementation, only a small residue of imports would remain at top level.

To verify that hypothesis, we ran a test against the D Standard Library.
Fortunately this is made easier by the fact that a concerted effort has already
been spent on making most imports local; for a non-exhaustive list, refer to
[PR4361](https://github.com/dlang/phobos/pull/4361),
[PR4365](https://github.com/dlang/phobos/pull/4365),
[PR4370](https://github.com/dlang/phobos/pull/4370),
[PR4373](https://github.com/dlang/phobos/pull/4373),
[PR4379](https://github.com/dlang/phobos/pull/4379),
[PR4392](https://github.com/dlang/phobos/pull/4392),
[PR4467](https://github.com/dlang/phobos/pull/4467). This work has taken the
standard library from all imports being top-level to the current setup whereby
4605 import statements are nested and only 426 (under 8.5% of total) have
remained at top level. (Note that nested imports need to be duplicated across
different scopes, so before the refactoring there were less than 4605 extra
imports at top level.)

It would appear that the process has been successful: only a small fraction of
all imports remained at top level; the vast majority have been pushed down into
implementation. This ought to have radically improved the dependency structure
of the standard library. However, to estimate the real cost of top-level
imports, _transitivity_ must be taken into account: any imported module
triggers in turn its own imports, transitively. The entirety of imported
modules is of importance for dependency management and build times.

To assess the real cost of the 8.5% top-level imports, we ran the following
experiment. We compiled in separation each module in the D standard library,
monitoring the number of imports. Only imports from the standard library itself
were considered, not the core runtime. This is because the refactoring effort
pushed in only standard library imports. Also, modules that simply wrap C APIs
have been eliminated as skewing the statistics. The compilation included the
`-unittest` flag, which instantiates virtually all templates defined in the
current module and therefore executes all local imports. The number obtained is
the number of imports that must be transitively acquired assuming everything in
the imported module is used. (It should be noted that the numbers obtained this
way are slightly higher because some code uses `version(unittest)` to
conditionally import modules used only during unittesting.)

We then repeated the compilation without `-unittest`, which estimates the cost
(in transitive imports) of building the respective module separately.

Finally, we compiled a separate small file that simply imports the measured
module without using any of it. This estimates the overhead (in transitive
imports) of importing the respective module without using any of it.

Numbers in the first column reflect the total dependencies of the module, if
every artifact in it is used by client code. Numbers in the second column are
smaller because they reflect dependency _deferral_---only non-template
functions are compiled. If local imports are used successfully, the difference
between the first and second column should be significant if the module in
question defines many template functions and relatively few non-template
functions. Most importantly for this experiment, the third column is the direct
measure of the efficacy of using local imports because it shows the true
overhead in imports for an imported module that is not used at all. If local
imports are good enough, that number should be 0 or close to 0.

The table in Appendix A lists all of these results, sorted by the count of
unittest imports in descending order. The table below shows the median and
average of the imports count for the entire standard library.

|Aggregate|Imports (unittest)|Imports (compile)|Imports (top)|
|---|---|---|---|
|Median|30|10|8|
|Average|28.0|13.8|10.5|

Another matter we investigated is how reducing top-level imports influences
build times and the size of the object files produced. We do not have an
experimental implementation of this DIP, so measuring impact directly was not
possible. We did the converse experiment---adding top-level imports.

In a separate branch of the standard library code, for each module we added all
nested imports back to the top level. Some hand-editing was needed after that
because of clashes in symbol names. Also, some imports needed to be removed
because of circular dependencies and related limitations in the language's
design and implementation. The resulting setup can be seen in
[PR4992](https://github.com/dlang/phobos/pull/4992). Then for each module in
the standard library we compiled one file that consists of exactly one `import`
declaration, monitoring compile time and object file size. Appendix B displays
build times and size of object files produced by this experiment.

|Aggregate|Time (top-level)|Object size (top-level)|Time (nested)|Object size (nested)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Median|320ms|13788|32ms|4296|
|Average|287.6ms|13437.2|64.6ms|5734.1|

As expected, the experiment shows that both build times and object file sizes
were improved by moving imports away from the top level. We estimate that
eliminating the 10.5x slack dependency fan-in will bring import costs down to
negligible and also bring object file size down.

The numbers show that good engineering improves matters significantly,  as
expected. However, the resulting state of affairs is far from optimum. On
average, for one standard library import, 10.5 more modules in the standard
library are imported. If the import is not used, and assuming in first
approximation that the total overhead of one import is proportional with the
total number of modules transitively imported, we're looking at an order of
magnitude overhead in dependency fan-in. As artifacts in the module do get
used, dependencies are realized and the waste goes down. Further improvements
would require a major project reorganization. We conclude that local imports
are not enough to ensure an efficient dependency structure, even after
discounting the other claimed advantages for maintainability, documentation,
and code clarity.

### Inline `import`s

We propose an addition to the D language that allows the use of the keyword
`import` as part of any function and aggregate declaration. When that syntax is
used, it instructs the compiler to execute the import before looking up any
names in the declaration. To clarify by means of example, the previous
declarations would be rewritten as:

```d
with (import std.stdio) void process(File input) ;
with (import std.range) struct Buffered(Range) if (isInputRange!Range)
{
    ...
}
```

With this syntax, the `import` is executed only if the declared name
(`process`) is actually looked up. Of course, simple caching will make several
imports of the same module as expensive as the first. The following section
motivates the use of the existing `with` statement as a declaration.

### Refresher on the `with` Statement

The [`with` statement](https://dlang.org/spec/statement.html#WithStatement) is
mainly used for manipulating multiple fields of an elaborate value. However,
`with` is more general, accepting a type or a template instance (which is
essentially a symbol table) as an argument. Consider:

```d
enum EnumType { enumValue = 42 }
struct StructType { static structValue = 43; alias T = int; }
class ClassType { static classValue = 44; alias T = double; }
template TemplateType(X) { auto templateValue = 45; alias T = X; }
void main()
{
    with (EnumType) { void fun(int x = enumValue); }
    with (StructType) { void gun(T x = structValue); }
    with (ClassType) { void hun(T x = classValue); }
    with (TemplateType!int) { void iun(T x = templateValue); }
}
```

These declarations all work as expected and depend on names scoped within the
type or template instance passed to `with`. This brings the `with` statement
semantically close to the lookup rules needed for this DIP.

We propose that `with (Type)` and `with (TemplateInstance)` are allowed as
declarations (not only statements). The language rules would be changed as
follows:

* Inside any function, all uses of `with` are statements and obey the current
  language rules.
* Everywhere else, `with (expression)` is not allowed. `with (Type)` and `with
  (TemplateInstance)` are always declarations and do not introduce a new scope.
  Lookup of symbols inside the `with` declarations is similar to lookup inside
  the `with` statement: symbols in the scopes of `Type` or `TemplateInstance`
  have priority (hide) symbols outside the `with` declaration.

In addition, we propose the statement and declaration `with (import
ImportList)`. `ImportList` is any syntactical construct currently accepted by
the `import` declaration. The `with (import ImportList)` declaration obeys the
following rules:

* Inside any function, `with (Import ImportList)` is a statement that
  introduces a scope. Inside the `with`, lookup considers the `import` local to
  the declaration (similar to the current handling of nested `import`s).
* Everywhere else, `with (Import ImportList)` is always a declaration and does
  not introduce a new scope. Lookup of symbols is the same as for the
  statement case.

This extension removes an unforced limitation of the current `with` syntax
(allows it to occur at top level) and introduces a natural extension from
symbol tables present in a type or template instance, to symbol tables imported
from a module. The drawback of this choice is the potentially confusing
handling of scopes: the `with` statement introduces a scope, whereas the `with`
declaration does not.

### The `with` Declaration

The usual grammar of the `import ImportList;` declaration applies inside the
`with (import ImportList)` declaration, with the following consequences:

* The usual lookup rules apply, for example either `with (import std.range)` or
  the more precise `with (import std.range.primitives)` may be used to look up
  `isInputRange`.
* Specific imports can be present as in `with (import std.range :
  isInputRange)` or `with (import std.range.primitives : isInputRange)`.
* Renamed imports may be present as in `with (import std.range : isInput =
  isInputRange)`. This specification precludes the use of `isInputRange` and
  requires the use of `isInput` instead.

The `static import` feature is also available with this syntax: `with (static
import ImportList)`.

Inline imports apply to all declarations (template or not) and may guard
multiple declarations:

```d
with (import module_a : A, B)
{
    struct Widget(T = A) { ... }
    alias C = B;
}
Widget!int g_widget;
```

As mentioned, `with` declarations do not introduce a scope so `Widget` above is
visible outside the `with` declaration, but `A` and `B` are not.

Inline imports apply to all declarations. This includes the `with` declaration
itself, having the consequence that multiple `with` import declarations may be
applied in a cascading manner:

```d
with (import module_a : A)
with (import module_b : B)
A fun(B) { ... }
```

### Lookup rules

When the name of a Dependency-Carrying Declaration is found via lookup, its
corresponding inline imports are executed. Then the name is resolved.

The visibility of the imported symbol(s) lasts through the end of the `with`
declaration. That includes function contracts and bodies and also module
constructors and inner functions.

The inline imports have priority over existing `import`s visible to the
declaration. This is so as to avoid other names present in the scope to have
equal footing with names immediately present in the declaration. The lookup is
equivalent to placing the inline `import`s in a scope unique to the
declaration, where they take precedence in name resolution just like scoped
imports per the current language rules. Example:

```d
import module_b;
with (import module_a) void fun(X value) { ... }
```

The name `X` is looked up as if the code was structured as follows:

```d
import module_b;
{
    import module_a;
    void fun(X value) { ... }
}
```

This equivalent code, however, is not legal at top level. In that case we can
artificially introduce an imaginary template to analyze lookup on compilable
code:

```d
import module_b;
template __unused()
{
    import module_a;
    void fun(X value) { ... }
}
```

The symbol `X` is looked up per the current language rules in the working code
above.

If two or more imports within the same `with` declaration define the same name,
name resolution across these is the same as if the imports were top-level.

If a module defines a symbol at top level and then imports a module, lookup
proceeds similarly with local imports. Consider:

```d
int writeln;
with (import std.stdio)
void main() { writeln("hello, world"); }
```

This code is in error because `writeln` has type int. However, the following
code is correct because it specifies the symbol name explicitly:

```d
int writeln;
with (import std.stdio : writeln)
void main() { writeln("hello, world"); }
```

### Examples

Below are a few examples taken from the standard library:

```d
with (import std.meta, std.range, std.traits)
auto uninitializedArray(T, I...)(I sizes) nothrow @system
if (isDynamicArray!T && allSatisfy!(isIntegral, I) &&
    hasIndirections!(ElementEncodingType!T))
{
    ...
}
```

Alternatively, the declaration may specify the exact symbols needed by using
multiple imports:

```d
with (import std.meta : allSatisfy)
with (import std.range : ElementEncodingType)
with (import std.traits : hasIndirections, isDynamicArray, isIntegral)
auto uninitializedArray(T, I...)(I sizes) nothrow @system
if (isDynamicArray!T && allSatisfy!(isIntegral, I) &&
    hasIndirections!(ElementEncodingType!T))
{
    ...
}
```

#### Alternative: Lazy Imports

Assume all `import`s are lazy without any change in the language. (This has
already been implemented in the SDC compiler.) The way the scheme works, all
`import`s seen are not yet executed but instead saved in a list of
package/module names. Following that, the actual imports are triggered by one
of two situations.

First, consider the current module looks up a fully specified name:

```d
import module_a, module_b;
void fun(T)(T value) if (module_a.condition!T)
{
    return module_b.process(value);
}
void fun(T)(T value) if (is(T == int)) { ... }
```

In this situation:

* If `fun` is never looked up, neither `module_a` nor `module_b` needs to be
  loaded.
* If `fun(42)` is used, even though the second overload is a match, then
  `module_a` must be loaded in order to ensure that `module_a.condition!int` is
  false so as to avoid ambiguity.
* If `fun` is called with a non-`int` value, `module_a` is loaded to evaluate
  the template constraint. If the constraint is true, then `module_b` is also
  loaded so as to look up `process`.

Let us note that full specification of symbols used may be enabled with ease by
using the `static import` feature. We will henceforth refer to this setup as
"the `static import` setup".

Second, consider the situation (arguably more frequent in today's D code) when
the current module does not fully specify names used. Instead, it imports the
appropriate modules and relies on lookup to resolve symbols appropriately:

```d
import module_a, module_b;
void fun(T)(T value) if (condition!T)
{
    return process(value);
}
void fun(T)(T value) if (is(T == int)) { ... }
```

In this situation:

* If `fun` is never used, neither module must be loaded.
* If `fun` is looked up, it will trigger an unspecified lookup for `condition`.
  This will trigger loading of both `module_a` and `module_b` (and generally
  all imports in the current module) so as to look up `condition` and ensure no
  ambiguity.

The same applies to the setup in which `condition` is imported selectively from
`module_a` but `module_b` is entirely imported:

```d
import module_a : condition;
import module_b;
void fun(T)(T value) if (condition!T)
{
    return process(value);
}
void fun(T)(T value) if (is(T == int)) { ... }
```

In this case, module `module_b` still needs to be opened if `fun` is looked up
to ensure no ambiguity exists for `condition`.

Finally, there is the case when all `import`s specify the list of symbols
imported:

```d
import module_a : condition;
import module_b : process;
void fun(T)(T value) if (condition!T)
{
    return process(value);
}
void fun(T)(T value) if (is(T == int)) { ... }
```

In this case, fine-grained loading of modules is possible: each module is
loaded only if a symbol inside it is used. We refer to this setup as "the
selective `import` setup".

To generalize the observations above, fine-grained loading of modules is
possible under either (or a combination of) the following circumstances: (a)
the `static import` setup; (b) the selective `import` setup.

The advantages of such approaches are:

* Fine-grained loading of imports is achieved with no changes in the language
  definition, only the implementation.
* Project discipline may be enforced with relative ease, either manually or by
  means of simple tools. The rule is: "All private imports must be either
  `static import` or selective `import`".

The disadvantages are:

* The fine-grained _dependency structure_ is not attained by the selective
  `import` approach. A declaration using unspecified names does not clarify
  which `import`s it implicitly relies on. The relationship at distance remains
  between the `import` and the use thereof.
* The `static import` setup does not share the issue above, at the cost of
  being cumbersome to use---all imported symbols must use full lookup
  everywhere. A reasonable engineering approach would be to define shorter
  names:

```d
    static import std.range.primitives;
    alias isInputRange = std.range.primitives.isInputRange;
    alias isForwardRange = std.range.primitives.isInputRange;
    ...
```

Such scaffolding is of course undesirable in the first place. Also, at least by
the current language rules, such `alias` definitions would need to load the
module anyway so as to ensure the name does exist. In order for this idiom to
work, it would require subtle changes to the language that specify how certain
`alias` declarations are exempt from early checking and delayed to the first
actual use.

* In either setup, `import`s are collapsed into their union, usually at the top
  of the module. Such lists grow out of sync with the actual code because
  during maintenance the programmer working on one declaration is not motivated
  to simultaneously alter a module-level `import` list shared by all
  declarations in the module. Over time, the `import`s grow into a superset of
  the actual depedencies used by the code, and do not reflect which
  declarations cause which imports even when accurate.
* The "carrying" aspect is lost: any migration of a declaration to another
  module must be followed by awkwardly doing surgery on the `import` list of
  the receiving module. Again, the migration may leave unused `import`s in the
  module the declaration is taken from. The only recourse to keeping the
  `import` list in sync is special tooling or time-consuming discipline (search
  the module for uses, attempt recompilation).

Although we consider introducing lazy imports an improvement over the current
state of affairs, our assessment is that such a feature would fall short of
truly allowing a project to rein in its dependency structure.

We have experimented with converting the standard library module `std.array` to
one of the two idioms. Conversion to either the "static import" form or the
"selective import" form may be achieved by brute force through dedicated
tooling: first generate code that enumerates all symbols in the module, then
eliminate them one by one and attempt to rebuild. Such an approach is
time-consuming and would be only used at rare intervals.

The manual conversion of `std.array` to the "static import" form is shown
[here](https://github.com/dlang/phobos/pull/4962). It leads to the expected
lengthening of the symbols used in declarations, which appears to eliminate one
disadvantage by introducing another. Also the manual conversion process turned
out to be prohibitively difficult; we would only recommend this conversion
using automated tooling.

The manual conversion of `std.array` to the "selective import" form is shown
[here](https://github.com/dlang/phobos/pull/4963). Conversion was successful
but because it collapses all `import`s at the top, it does not make it much
easier to identify e.g. what dependencies would be pulled if a given artifact
in `std.array` were used. Again the manual process was highly nontrivial.

#### Syntactic Alternatives

There are a number of alternative approaches that have been (and some still
are) considered.

* Specify `import` in a manner reminiscent of attributes:

  ```d
      void process(File input) import (std.stdio);
      struct Buffered(import std.range)(Range) if (isInputRange!Range)
      {
          ...
      }
  ```

  This form had significant differences from both the property syntax and the
  existing `import` syntax.

* Add syntax to allow for an optional `import` declaration inside declarations:

  ```d
      void process(import std.stdio)(File input);
      struct Buffered(import std.range)(Range) if (isInputRange!Range)
      {
          ...
      }
  ```

  This has the advantage of being less verbose in case the same module is looked
  up several times. The disadvantages are a heavier and more ambiguous syntax
  (two sets of parens for nontemplates, three for templates) and an unclear
  relationship between the `import`ed entities and the symbols used in the
  declaration.

* Use `import` as a pseudo-package such that symbols are written like this:

  ```d
          void process(import.std.stdio.File input);
          struct Buffered(Range) if (import.std.range.isInputRange!Range)
          {
              ...
          }
  ```

  Such an option has an ambiguity problem shown by Timon Gehr: is
  `import.std.range.isInputRange` looking up symbol `isInputRange` in
  module/package `std.range`, or the symbol `range.isInputRange` (e.g. a `struct`
  member) in module/package `std`?

* Stay as close to the existing `import` syntax as possible. This has the
  advantage of being instantly recognized, but the disadvantage of looking out
  of place within the declaration:

  ```d
          void process(File input) import std.stdio;
          struct Buffered(Range) if (isInputRange!Range)
          import std.range;
          {
              ...
          }
  ```

  One syntactical issue is that in this case the semicolon ending the `import`
  may or may not end the declaration; the scanner (and human reader) would need
  to look ahead to figure whether a definition continues (by means of an open
  brace, the `in` keyword, or the `out` keyword), or the declaration ends there.

* Alternatively, the semicolon might be omitted in the approach above. This
  causes no syntactical ambiguity but makes the hanging `import` declaration
  even more out of place:

  ```d
          void process(File input) import std.stdio;
          struct Buffered(Range) if (isInputRange!Range)
          import std.range
          {
              ...
          }
  ```

* Use property syntax.

  ```d
      @deps!({import std.stdio; pragma(lib, "curl"); }):
      // applies to 1 below
      @deps!({import std.range})
      void fun(T)(isInputRange!T){} // depends on both deps
      void fun2(File file){}  // depends on 1st deps ending with ':'
  ```

  This adds no syntax to the language, only semantics. Another advantage is it
  supports other artifacts aside from `import` such as `pragma` illustrated
  above. The compiler would recognize `@deps` as a special attribute and would
  only allow certain constructs inside the lambda inside the attribute. The
  disadvantage of this approach is that of any non-specialized syntax---it is
  relatively unstructured and more difficult to follow.

* Add no syntax at all; allow top-level braces. The most Spartan of all
  syntaxes simply allows top-level scopes:

  ```d
  {
      import std.stdio;
      void fun(File f) { ... }
  }
  void gun(); // no access to std.stdio here
  ```

  We believe this syntax has similar advantages and disadvantages to C++
  namespaces, which force indentation of everything within the scope. This
  has been long considered a nuisance of C++ namespaces, worked around in
  projects in one of two ways. One possibility is to define macros that enter
  and leave a namespace, see e.g.
  [1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/CPP_DOC/lxr/ident?i=BEGIN_NAMESPACE),
  [2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37907516/what-is-the-macro-qt-begin-namespace-mean-in-qt-5),
  [3](https://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/feedback/details/1154097/c-intellisense-doesnt-work-correctly-with-namespace-macros),
  [4](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2331557/declaring-namespace-as-macro-c).
  Another possibility is to not indent the code and have special editor
  indentation rules, see e.g.
  [1](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13825188/suppress-c-namespace-indentation-in-emacs),
  [2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3727862/is-there-any-way-to-make-visual-studio-stop-indenting-namespaces),
  [3](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2549019/how-to-avoid-namespace-content-indentation-in-vim).
  We expect similar issues and workarounds with such a feature in D.

### Breaking changes / deprecation process

We do not anticipate any breaking changes brought by this language addition.
The syntactical construct proposed is currently not accepted.

The inline imports specified with a declaration do not affect its type (e.g.
the function type for a function declaration).

The changes to declaration syntax will impact third-party documentation
generators, so they would need to be updated. There is an advantage
herein---documentation generators (including ddoc itself) can show the user the
dependencies that each declaration would incur.

## Future Possibilities and Directions

Inline and scoped imports offer the option of better handling of static module
constructors. Currently, modules that mutually `import` one another (either
directly or through a longer chain) cannot simultaneously define `shared static
this()` constructors. The reason is that, again, dependencies are computed at
module level.

If instead modules have no top-level dependencies, then the compiler is able to
compute the narrow set of dependencies needed for executing the static module
constructor. The static constructor may be (a) a part of a `with` declaration,
(b) use local imports within, and (c) call other functions within the module
that have their own dependencies. For example:

```d
// assume no top-level import
with (module_a) void fun(T)()
{
    import module_b;
    return gun();
}
with (module_c)
static shared this()
{
    import module_d;
    fun!int;
}
```

In this case, the module constructor depends (only) on `module_a`, `module_b`,
`module_c`, and `module_d`. The full information is confined within the current
module so it is inferrable during separate compilation.

## Appendix A: Imported Modules in the D Standard Library

The table below displays the total (transitive) imports needed for compiling
separately each module in the D Standard Library. The first column is the
module filename. The second column is the total number of imports needed to
compile the module for unittesting (which instantiates virtually all templates
and therefore pulls their local imports). The third column is the total number
of imports needed to compile the module. The fourth column is the overhead in
top-level imported modules needed to import the module without using it.
